# 🏡 House Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various features like location, Area, number of bedrooms, and more. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates property prices using historical data.

### 📊 Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
Model evaluation and performance comparison
Deployment using Flask/Streamlit (optional)
# 📁 Dataset

## The dataset includes features such as:
- Size (Square footage)
- Number of bedrooms & bathrooms
- Age of the property
- Market trends
- etc
# 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization
- Flask/Streamlit for deployment (optional)
# 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
 ```python
   code
   https://github.com/alinazar32/House-Price-predictor.git
```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook for training the model.

3. (Optional) Deploy the model using Flask/Streamlit.

# 📌 Future Improvements
- Adding more advanced models (XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- Feature selection & hyperparameter tuning
- Integration with real estate APIs for live data
