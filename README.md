#🏡 House Price Prediction

📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates property prices using historical data.

📊 Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
Model evaluation and performance comparison
Deployment using Flask/Streamlit (optional)
📁 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:

Location (City/Neighborhood)
Size (Square footage)
Number of bedrooms & bathrooms
Age of the property
Market trends
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization
Flask/Streamlit for deployment (optional)
🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook for training the model.

(Optional) Deploy the model using Flask/Streamlit.

📌 Future Improvements
