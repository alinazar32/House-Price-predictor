#🏡 House Price Prediction

##📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various features like location, Area, number of bedrooms, and more. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates property prices using historical data.

###📊 Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
Model evaluation and performance comparison
Deployment using Flask/Streamlit (optional)
#📁 Dataset
##The dataset includes features such as:

Location (City/Neighborhood)
Size (Square footage)
Number of bedrooms & bathrooms
Age of the property
Market trends
#🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization
Flask/Streamlit for deployment (optional)
